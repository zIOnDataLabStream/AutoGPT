### Getting Started with Your AutoGPT Agent and Hackathon 🚀

To get started with building your own agent and participating in the hackathon, follow the quickstart guide below:

1. **Set up your environment:**
   - Install the OpenAI Python library by running `pip install openai`. 🐍
   - Clone the AutoGPT repository by running `git clone https://github.com/ChristopherTavaresBR/Auto-GPT-BR`. 🚗
   - Navigate to the AutoGPT directory using `cd AutoGPT` and install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 🛠️

2. **Create your agent in the Forge:**
   - The Forge is your innovation lab where you can build your own groundbreaking agent. 🔨
   - Check out the tutorials in the Forge directory to understand the basics of creating an agent. 📘
   - Customize and modify the existing code or create a new agent from scratch to meet your requirements and ideas. 🛠️

3. **Test your agent using the Benchmark:**
   - The Benchmark provides a testing environment to evaluate the performance of your agent objectively. 📊
   - Use the benchmark script provided in the `benchmark` directory to run your agent and measure its performance. ⚙️
   - Submit your benchmark run through the UI to enter the hackathon. 🏁

4. **Use the UI to control and monitor your agents:**
   - The UI acts as your personal command center, giving you a user-friendly interface to interact with and monitor your agents. 🖥️
   - Follow the provided guide to activate and switch to the best-performing agent as the primary AutoGPT. 🌐

5. **Follow the Agent Protocol for seamless compatibility:**
   - AutoGPT employs the agent protocol from the AI Engineer Foundation to standardize communication pathways between your agent, the frontend, and the benchmark. 🔄
   - Make sure to adhere to the agent protocol specifications to maximize compatibility and ensure seamless integration with the AutoGPT framework. 🤝

By following these steps, you can quickly get started with building your own agent, testing its performance, and participating in the hackathon. Good luck with your innovative agent creation! 🌟
